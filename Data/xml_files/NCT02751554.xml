  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help develop a special PET/CT scan to help the investigator
      to develop a new drug and see where this drug goes in the body and how long it stays in
      diseased and normal tissue. The drug is called PU-AD. In this study, the investigators will
      give a tiny dose of PU-AD, a dose which they expect to be much too small to affect the
      disease. This tiny dose will be labeled with (attached to) a very small amount of radiation
      (called Iodine-124 or 124I) so that the investigators can follow where it goes in the body by
      using a PET/CT scanner. Doing this will help the investigators figure out how to best give
      higher doses of PU-AD to other patients in the future, and will help the investigators see if
      this tiny dose of PU-AD with radiation (124I-PU-AD) might be used in the future to detect
      disease using a PET/CT scanner.

    <description>A single dose of 124I-PU-AD will be administered by intravenous (IV) injection; the formulation includes a microgram PU-AD dose (minimal toxicity risk) and predicted radiation exposure comparable to that of standard radiology exams. Patients are prescribed a standard clinical oral iodine regimen to reduce thyroid exposure. In all study patients, the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and biodistribution of 124I-PU-AD will be evaluated by non-invasive blood- and positron emission tomography (PET)-based assays, at multiple time points, over a period of two days (2 scans on the first day and 1 scan on the second day), with a third day (i.e. optional 4th scan) in willing patients.</description>
