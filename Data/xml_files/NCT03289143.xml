  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of RO7105705 in participants with prodromal to mild Alzheimer's disease.
      An optional 96-week open-label extension period will be available to participants who
      complete the double-blind treatment period and who, in the judgment of the investigator,
      would potentially benefit from open-label RO7105705 treatment.

             cerebrospinal fluid Aβ1−42 OR amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan.
             Historical amyloid PET scans may be accepted in some cases

          -  Mild AD symptomatology, as defined by a screening Mini-Mental State Examination score
             of &gt;= 20 points and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) −Global Score of 0.5 or 1

          -  Abnormal memory function at screening

          -  Availability of a person with sufficient contact with the participant to be able to

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Residence in a skilled nursing facility

          -  Any serious medical condition or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that remains

          -  Use of any experimental therapy within 90 days or 5 half-lives prior to screening,
             whichever is greater and any passive immunotherapy (immunoglobulin) against tau,
             except use of RO7105705 in Genentech Study GN39058, as long as the last dose was at
             least 90 days prior to screening

          -  Use of any passive immunotherapy (immunoglobulin) against Aβ, unless the last dose was
             at least 1 year prior to screening and any active immunotherapy (vaccine) that is
             under evaluation to prevent or postpone cognitive decline

          -  Any previous treatment with medications specifically intended to treat Parkinsonian
             symptoms or any other neurodegenerative disorder within 1 year of screening

          -  Systemic immunosuppressive therapy within 12 months of screening through the entire

          -  Typical antipsychotic or neuroleptic medication within 6 months of screening

          -  Daily treatment with any of the following classes of medication, except for
             intermittent short-term use, which is permitted except within 2 days or 5 half-lives
             (whichever is longer) prior to any COA: atypical antipsychotics, opiates or opioids,
             benzodiazepines, barbiturates, hypnotics, or any medication with centrally-acting
             antihistamine or anticholinergic activity

          -  Stimulant medications, unless the dose has been stable within the 6 months prior to
