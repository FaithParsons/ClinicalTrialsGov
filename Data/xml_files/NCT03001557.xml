  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of
      lemborexant (4 dose levels) or placebo taken daily for 4 weeks in approximately 125 male or
      female participants, ages 60 to 90 years, with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease dementia
      (AD-D) who complain of disrupted sleep or multiple awakenings at night along with frequent
      periods of falling asleep during the day that impact the quality of life of the participant.
      The study is designed to determine the dose response of lemborexant on the change from
      baseline in actigraphy Sleep Efficiency (aSE) and actigraphy Wake Efficiency (aWE) during the
      last week of 4 weeks of treatment in participants with Irregular Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder
      (ISWRD) and AD-D.
