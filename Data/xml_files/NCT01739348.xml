    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts, Part I and Part II. The purpose of Part I of the study is
      to assess the efficacy and safety of verubecestat (MK-8931) compared with placebo
      administered for 78 weeks in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The primary study
      hypotheses for Part I are that at least one verubecestat dose is superior to placebo at 78
      weeks of treatment with respect to change from Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment
      Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) score and that at least one verubecestat dose is superior
      to placebo at 78 weeks of treatment with respect to change from Baseline in Alzheimer's
      Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) score. The first
      approximately 400 participants entering Part I of the study are identified as the Safety
      Cohort. Participants who complete Part I of the study may choose to participate in Part II,
      which is a long term double-blind extension to assess efficacy and safety of verubecestat
      administered for up to an additional 260 weeks.

      Two substudies are included in Part I of the study: 1) a medical imaging substudy to evaluate
      changes in brain amyloid protein load using positron emission tomography (PET) and an amyloid
      tracer ([18F]flutemetamol); and 2) a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker substudy to evaluate
      changes in CSF concentrations of amyloid-Î² related peptides, total tau, and phosphorylated
      tau (p-tau). The substudies will be conducted only at designated investigational sites.
      Participants are not required to take part in a substudy in order to take part in the larger
      trial.

             cerebrovascular disease, thyroid disease, endocrine disturbance, congestive heart
             failure, cardiac or gastrointestinal disease, dialysis, or abnormal renal function)

             infarction, heart surgery, syncope, bradycardia, or clinically significant hypotension
