  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of MK-7622
      compared with placebo as adjunctive therapy to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) for
      the symptomatic treatment of participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The
      trial consists of two stages: Stage 1 and Stage 2. Participants in Stage 1 will be randomized
      to receive either placebo or MK-7622 45 mg once daily. In Stage 2, participants will be
      randomized to receive either placebo, or MK-7622 5, 15 or 45 mg once daily. Participants will
      be enrolled in only one stage. Interim analyses will be performed in both Stage 1 and Stage 2
      to determine whether the trial should continue. Duration of each stage is approximately 26
      weeks; all participants receive placebo at some time during the trial. The primary study
      hypotheses are the following: Stage 1 - MK-7622 45 mg once daily is superior to placebo in
      improving cognition in participants with mild to moderate AD as assessed by mean change from
      baseline in the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog11)
      at Week 12; Stage 2 - At least one of the top two doses of MK-7622 (15 mg once daily, 45 mg
      once daily) is superior to placebo in improving cognition in participants with mild to
      moderate AD as assessed by mean change from baseline in ADAS-Cog11 at Week 12.

      If double-blind treatment dose is not tolerated during first 2 weeks, participant will be
      discontinued. After first 2 weeks, if dose is not tolerated regimen may be modified according
      to defined algorithm, beginning with administration of reduced dose for up to 2 weeks, then
      rechallenge at original dose, if tolerability issues diminish or resolve at reduced dose.
