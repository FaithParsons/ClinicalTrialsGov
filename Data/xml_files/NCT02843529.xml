  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to evaluate the performance of the ALTOIDA™ System as a tool
      to assist physicians in diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in real-world clinical settings.
      The design of this study is guided by two overriding factors: 1) to optimize the performance
      of the ALTOIDA™ neuromotor classifiers, the subjects making up the training sets must be well
      characterized as to their clinical diagnosis, and 2) all ALTOIDA™ tests must be performed and
      reproduced in real-world clinical settings.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine relationships among the clinical, cognitive, imaging,
      genetic, and biochemical biomarker characteristics of the stage of the AD spectrum that
      precedes MCI, the mildest symptomatic phase of AD, referred to here as EMCI. The ADNI-GO
      model posits that AD begins with amyloid β (Aβ) deposition in the cortex, which leads to
      synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and cognitive/ functional decline.

      Some of the leading-edge technologies under study are brain-imaging techniques, such as
      positron emission tomography (PET), including FDG-PET (which measures glucose metabolism in
      the brain); PET using a radioactive compound (F-AV-45) that measures brain beta-amyloid; and
      structural MRI. Brain scans are showing scientists how the brain's structure and function
      change as AD starts and progresses. Biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid are revealing other
      changes that could identify which patients with MCI will develop Alzheimer's. Scientists are
      looking at levels of beta-amyloid and tau in cerebrospinal fluid. (Abnormal amounts of the
      amyloid and tau proteins in the brain are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.)

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of the ALTOIDA™ System as as a tool to
      assist physicians in diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in real-world clinical settings.

      The study will be :

      A. Multi-Center Study:

      primary goal of this study will be to evaluate the ALTOIDA™ Platform across multiple study
      locations. This will demonstrate an ability to perform tests, collect data, and generate
      classifications irrespective of variations in testing locations and personnel.

      7-8 study sites will be selected with each site being a recognized NIH Center of Excellence
      for Alzheimer's disease or other nationally recognized Alzheimer's disease research center.

      Each site will evaluate up to 60 subjects evenly divided between AD patients and age-matched
      controls (while the prevalence of AD is approximately 12% in the general population, the
      ratio of AD to normal among those who visit a clinic for memory or cognitive related issues
      is between 50-60%).

      Each site will follow the same testing protocols. All test data will be uploaded to the
      online ALTOIDA™ database server.

      B. The overall impact of this study will be increased knowledge concerning the sequence and
      timing of events leading to MCI and AD, development of better clinical and neuromotor
      biomarker methods for early detection and for monitoring the progression of these conditions,
      and facilitation of clinical trials of treatments to slow disease progression, ultimately
      contributing to the prevention of AD.
