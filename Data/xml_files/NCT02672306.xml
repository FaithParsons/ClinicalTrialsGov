  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)Score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks from post-administration</time_frame>
    <description>A psychometric instrument that evaluates memory, attention, reasoning, language, orientation, and praxis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinician's Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CCGIC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks from post-administration</time_frame>
    <description>A systematic method for assessing clinically significant change in a clinical trial as viewed by an independent skilled and experienced clinician . The ADCS-CGIC focuses on clinician's observations of change in the subject's cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of a trial. It relies on both direct examination of the subject and an interview of an informant. Unlike a targeted symptom scale, it takes into account a subject's overall function in the cognitive, behavioral, and functional activity domains.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks from post-administration</time_frame>
    <description>A frequently used screening instrument for Alzheimer's disease drug studies. It evaluates orientation, memory, attention, concentration, naming, repetition, comprehension, and ability to create a sentence and to copy two intersecting polygons</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks from post-administration</time_frame>
    <description>ADCS-ADL assesses functional performance in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In a structured interview format, informants are queried as to whether subjects attempted each item in the inventory during the prior 4 weeks and their level of performance. The ADCS-ADL scale discriminates well between normal controls and mild AD patients. It has good test-retest reliability. The ADCS-ADL includes some items from traditional basic ADL scales (e.g., grooming, dressing, walking, bathing, feeding, toileting) as well as items from instrumental activities of daily living scales (e.g., shopping, preparing meals, using household appliances, keeping appointments, reading).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks from post-administration</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI is a well-validated, reliable, multi-item instrument to assess psychopathology and behavior in AD based on interview with the informant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in AD Biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks from post-administration</time_frame>

    <measure>Symptoms Checklist and Adverse Event Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events and symptoms checklist are used to monitor signs or symptoms that may or may not be related to study medication, abnormalities detected during physical examination, or clinical significant laboratory abnormalities.</description>
