    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of the experimental treatment
      (cognitive training) further outlined in this protocol on the cognitive abilities (e.g.,
      processing speed, attention, working memory, and executive function), brain functionality,
      functional status and quality of life of individuals with age-related cognitive decline as
      compared to a computer-based active control.
