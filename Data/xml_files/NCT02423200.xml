  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effects of VX-745 on markers of disease in the central nervous
      system of patients with MCI due to AD or with mild AD. The study will also evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of VX-745 in these patients during 6 weeks of dosing, as well as the
      plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of VX-745 during dosing.

               -  Amnestic presentation on neuropsychological testing with rapid forgetting (%
                  reduction 1.5 standard deviations below the mean)

               -  Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Sum of Box (SOB) score â‰¥0.5

               -  Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) range: 20 to 30

          -  Significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, liver, infectious disease, immune
             disorder or metabolic/endocrine disorders or other disease that would preclude
             treatment with p38 MAP kinase inhibitor and/or assessment of drug safety and efficacy

          -  Positive urine or serum pregnancy test or plans desires to become pregnant during the
             course of the trial

          -  Donation of &gt;500 mL of blood or blood products within 2 months
